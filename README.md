# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
This project is a Python-based face recognition attendance system that uses OpenCV, face_recognition, and pandas libraries to identify individuals and log attendance. The system is designed to work with a webcam to capture real-time images and match them against a preloaded database of known faces stored in a CSV file.
